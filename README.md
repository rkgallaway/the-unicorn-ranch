# Unicorn Ranch Code Challenge.  

**********************************

## the code contained in this submit is from my original pairing with Brook
* I have not coded on the project, but have thought about what I will do. here is the plan:
  *  use a constructor to instantiate and populate an array of unicorns
  * dynamically render these unicorns into the table 
  * use a select element to display the current location of each unicorn
  * onchange of the select element, the class of the td will change and so will the location of the unicorn.
  * this change would be updated on server in 301-land, or updated in local storage in 201-land
  * I intend to use the 201 skills/tools to complete as much as possible in one hour
  * not expecting to get to local storage, but hoping to change location in the array of unicorns
